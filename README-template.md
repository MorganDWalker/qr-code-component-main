## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I refreshed my memory of how to work with the basics of HTML and CSS using classes within css to make changes to a specific div and how to properly align items with CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
to get the box aligned I did this
```css
.attribution {
      font-size: 15px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: auto;
    margin-top: 10%;
    width: 13%;
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    }
```


### Continued development

I want to refresh myself on responsiveness with CSS to make a mobile layout.
